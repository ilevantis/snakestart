## Install

Requires [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html) and [conda-env](https://github.com/conda/conda-env).

```bash
git clone ilevantis/<PROJECTNAME>
cd <PROJECTDIR>
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Substitute `environment.yml` for `exact-environment.yml` to install identical package versions instead of latest versions. 

## Run pipeline

Ensure links in `input_data` are pointing to the correct locations.

```bash
snakemake analysis
```

## How this works

To list all available snakemake defined rules/commands:

```bash
snakemake -l
```

### Directories

+ `docs` contains `wid.md`, reports, charts, notes etc...
+ `input_data` contains files/links to all data that the pipeline requires to run
+ `manual_steps` contains files that were used during manual editing steps. Files produced manually for use in the pipeline should be copied to or linked from `input_data`
+ `scripts` contains short scripts for use in manual steps or as part of the pipeline
+ All folders beginning with digits contain data entirely generated by the pipeline and are ignored by git. Generally these are not to be edited.

### Useful files in root directory

+ `snakefile`
+ `README.md`
+ `environment.yml`/`exact-environment.yml`
+ `.gitignore`
